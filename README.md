# auto-open-tabs
A Chrome extension to auto open particular tabs when clicked on.   
   
I am a student and every morning when I open my laptop, I have this routine of opening my personal and college mails and my trading account. I thought about automating the   process. Here is the result. It's an easy to use chrome extension.    
What it does is, on clickcing the extension icon, it will open all the tabs that you've selected, automatically.    
You can program it to open as many tabs as you like.   
   
## How to use it?   
Just clone this repo to your own machine.   
   
### Modifying for your own requirement   

Make sure python is installed on your computer.    
Open Terminal and navigate to the cloned repository.    
Navigate to AutoOpenTabs.    
Execute main.py by typing - python main.py    
Follow the instructions and add as many URLS as you would like.    
   
### Adding to Chrome   
   
Goto chrome://extensions in your chrome browser.   
Enable "developer mode" in the upper right corner.   
Then hit "Load Unpacked" and select the directory - AutoOpenTabs from the directory where you cloned this project.   
The extension is now added and working. Look out for the "O" icon in the extensions with the description - "Open your day to day tabs".   
You can also pin it.
